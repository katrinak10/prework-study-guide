        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements that perform distinct roles
          <li>DOCTYPE html, html, head, meta, and title is used by the browser so that the page renders correctly</li>
          <li>The head element contains information (or metadata) about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Common elements used to divide and describe a page include meta-related elements, content division elements, and semantic elements</li>
          <li>Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element</li>
          <li>The title elment defines the title for a webppage and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines like Google or Bing</li>
          <li>Style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewpoint</li>
          </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS = Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout and organization</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS</li>
          <li>Internal CSS style sheet- embeds an entire stylesheet directly into the HTML file using a style element in the head element</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, making design changes easier</li>
          <li>When using external style sheet, link the file using the link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns - separating code into different files based on use; each section of code should have its own responsibility</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>CSS Box Model: Margin to border to padding to content</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
  <h2>Git</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>git status checks what branch we are currently on</li>
    <li>git checkout -b branch-name creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
    <li>git add -A adds the changed files in our working directory to the staging area of Git</li>
    <li>git commit -m "add starter code" describes what the commit contains</li>
    <li>git pull origin main double-checks that our local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub</li>
    <li>git push origin feature/"name of feature" creates a new remote branch or adds new changes to an existing branch</li>
    <li>Once in your repository in GitHub, change the branch to the newest branch to be merged and refresh the page to confirm that the changes you pushed are now in the feature branch in GitHub</li>
  </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact with websites</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>The word console refers to a test enviroment that developers use to check out their code</li>
          <li>Styles.css file is linked within the head element, whereas the script.js file is linked within the body element</li>
          <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>
          <li>To work with individual data inside an array, we need the location of the data item in the array; this location is identified with a unique numnber called an index</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task; functions control when code is executed</li>
          <li>Functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run; you must call a function by name in order to execute it</li>
