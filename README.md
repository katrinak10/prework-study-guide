# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to assist in learning how to utilize HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. The notes provided in each section contain key takeaways from the pre-work study guide for the LPS Penn Bootcamp. It also provided a fantastic, contextual introduction to what we will be learning in the first part of our bootcamp. Throughout the bootcamp, I can go back to this resource guide to refresh my basic knowledge surrounding HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. I especially learned that it will be critically important to carefully follow directions when learning to code.
